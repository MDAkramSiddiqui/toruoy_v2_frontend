          <b-list-group>
            <b-list-group-item>
              No need to create any ID or use some authentic gmail id, just
              click on
              <b-badge variant="info"> create-handle </b-badge>
              button and voila your id will be created.
            </b-list-group-item>
            <b-list-group-item>
              After creating your ID, you can either create chat rooms and ask
              your friends to join or you can join their custom chat rooms.
            </b-list-group-item>
            <b-list-group-item>
              Each and every message is encrypted and thus all your secret chats
              are protected. The thing is you can only use text here. Still in
              the developement phase, Peace.
            </b-list-group-item>
            <b-list-group-item>
              Your handle will be remain activated for about a day after that
              your handle will be destroyed. During your login period everytime
              you open the website, your pre-created handle will open. To use
              new handle either use Incognito or logout from this handle, but
              after logging out all your chat room will be destroyed immediately
              as well as all your chats.
            </b-list-group-item>
            <b-list-group-item>
              All chat rooms are active for about 15 minutes only, after that it
              will be destroyed along with its chats, so keep tight and join and
              text quickly. Peace
